# Known Issues

This document tracks current known issues, bugs, and limitations in the FSharp.MCP.DevKit project.

## Active Issues

### High Priority

#### Documentation Generation Issues

**Issue:** `fake.core.commandlineparsing` fails to generate documentation
- **Status:** üîç Investigating
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** This specific FAKE package has a unique F# compilation pattern that the documentation generator doesn't recognize
- **Affected Components:** Documentation generation system
- **Workaround:** None currently
- **Tracking:** First reported during FAKE packages documentation generation
- **Next Steps:** 
  - Analyze the assembly structure of fake.core.commandlineparsing
  - Identify the specific F# compilation patterns causing the failure
  - Extend the F# module detection logic

### Medium Priority

#### Performance Issues

**Issue:** Large assembly documentation generation is slow
- **Status:** üìã Acknowledged
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Documentation generation for large assemblies (>1000 types) can take several minutes
- **Affected Components:** DocGenerator.fs
- **Workaround:** Generate documentation in smaller batches
- **Next Steps:**
  - Profile the documentation generation process
  - Implement parallel processing for type analysis
  - Add progress reporting for long-running operations

#### Code Editing Limitations

**Issue:** Limited support for advanced F# syntax
- **Status:** üìã Planned
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Some advanced F# features (computation expressions, type providers) have limited analysis support
- **Affected Components:** FSharpCodeEditing.fs, SmartSymbolDetectionService
- **Next Steps:** Planned for v1.2.0 milestone

### Low Priority

#### Minor UI/UX Issues

**Issue:** Namespace overview files could show package origins
- **Status:** üí° Enhancement
- **Priority:** Low
- **Description:** When viewing namespace overviews, it would be helpful to see which package each type comes from
- **Affected Components:** Documentation generation templates
- **Next Steps:** Consider for future UI improvements

## Resolved Issues

### ‚úÖ Fixed in Recent Updates

#### Duplicate Types in Namespace Overviews
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
- **Description:** Namespace overview files were showing duplicate type entries when types appeared in multiple assemblies
- **Resolution:** Implemented deduplication logic in namespace generation
- **Fixed in:** Recent documentation generator updates

#### Incorrect Pluralization in Type Counts
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed  
- **Description:** Type count summaries showed "Classs" instead of "Classes"
- **Resolution:** Fixed pluralization logic in type counting
- **Fixed in:** Recent documentation generator updates
