**Full Name:** `Fake.Core.Context`
**Summary:** This module tracks the context of the build.
 
 This allows us to run some modules without any context and change behavior depending on the context
 (For example Fake.Process kills all processes when the Fake Context exists, but it should not when used
 as library)
