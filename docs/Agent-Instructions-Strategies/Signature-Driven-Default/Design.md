# F# Signature-Driven Development Strategy for Agent Development

## Core Philosophy

Signature-driven development is a design-first methodology that leverages F#'s type system and signature files (`.fsi`) to build robust, well-documented, and testable software. It's about **programming by contract**, where the public API and types are defined and documented before the implementation is written. This approach ensures clarity of intent and a strong architectural foundation.

Unlike REPL-driven development, which focuses on exploration, or script-driven development, which emphasizes reproducible artifacts, signature-driven development prioritizes a deliberate, top-down design process that is enforced by the F# compiler.

## What Makes Signature-Driven Development Effective

1.  **Compiler-Enforced Design**: Signature files ensure that the implementation adheres to the public API defined in the `.fsi` file.
2.  **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The public interface is cleanly separated from the implementation details.
3.  **Enhanced Testability**: By defining the public API first, you can write tests against the signatures before the implementation is complete.
4.  **Improved Collaboration**: Team members can work on different parts of the codebase, relying on the signature files as a contract.
5.  **Documentation as Code**: Signature files act as a form of living documentation that is always in sync with the code.

## Core Workflow

1.  **Plan and Design**: Develop a detailed plan and roadmap with milestones.
2.  **Define Architecture**: Plan the files and their responsibilities. The F# single-pass compiler makes the order of files important.
3.  **Write Signature Files**: Define the types and function signatures in `.fsi` files, including XML documentation comments to describe the intent.
4.  **Develop Tests**: Write unit tests that target the signatures. These tests will fail initially.
5.  **Implement the Code**: Write the implementation code in the corresponding `.fs` files.
6.  **Run Tests**: Run the tests to verify that the implementation correctly fulfills the contract defined by the signatures.
7.  **Iterate and Refine**: Refine the design and implementation as needed, always keeping the signatures, tests, and implementation in sync.

## Key Advantages

### Design Clarity and Rigor
- **Upfront design decisions** - forces careful consideration of the public API.
- **Reduced API surface** - encourages exposing only what is necessary.
- **Self-documenting code** - signatures provide a clear overview of the module's functionality.

### Agent-Friendly Characteristics
- **Structured workflow** - a clear, step-by-step process for the agent to follow.
- **Compiler feedback** - the agent can use compiler errors to guide the development process.
- **Test-driven validation** - tests provide clear success/failure signals.

### Development Process Benefits
- **Parallel development** - developers can work on different modules concurrently.
- **Easier refactoring** - the impact of changes can be assessed by looking at the signature files.
- **Improved maintainability** - new developers can quickly understand the public API.
