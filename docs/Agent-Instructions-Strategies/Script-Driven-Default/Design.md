# F# Script-Driven Development Strategy for Agent Development

## Core Philosophy

Script-driven development is fundamentally about **programming through reproducible artifacts** - building software by creating self-contained, executable scripts that validate functionality, document decisions, and provide structured feedback for analysis.

Unlike REPL-driven development, script-driven development emphasizes reproducibility, auditability, and automated validation through structured execution of standalone test artifacts.

## What Makes Script-Driven Development Effective

Script-driven development provides several key characteristics that make it particularly suitable for agent-driven workflows:

1. **Reproducible Execution**: Scripts can be run multiple times with identical results
2. **Structured Output**: `printfn` statements create parseable logs for automated analysis
3. **Standalone Validation**: Each script is self-contained and can validate specific functionality
4. **Audit Trail**: Scripts serve as executable documentation of development decisions
5. **Automated Testing**: Scripts can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for regression testing
6. **Incremental Development**: Build complexity through a series of validated script artifacts

## Core Workflow

1. **Design the solution architecture** and identify core mechanisms needed
2. **Create a project structure** to house the new functionality
3. **Implement core functionality** in library modules
4. **Compile as NuGet package** for distribution and reusability
5. **Create validation scripts** with comprehensive `printfn` statements for testing
6. **Execute scripts via `dotnet fsi`** to validate functionality and gather feedback
7. **Analyze script output** to make informed development decisions
8. **Iterate and refine** based on structured feedback from script execution
9. **Extract stable components** for reuse in future development cycles

## Key Advantages

### Reproducibility and Reliability
- **Deterministic execution** - scripts produce consistent results across runs
- **Version control friendly** - all artifacts are text-based and trackable
- **Environment independence** - scripts can run in any F# environment
- **Regression testing** - automated validation of functionality over time

### Agent-Friendly Characteristics
- **Structured feedback** - `printfn` output is easily parsed by agents
- **Clear success/failure indicators** - explicit validation results
- **Comprehensive logging** - detailed insight into execution flow
- **Modular validation** - test specific aspects independently

### Development Process Benefits
- **Documentation through code** - scripts serve as executable specifications
- **Incremental validation** - validate each component as it's built
- **Component reusability** - NuGet packages enable cross-project sharing
- **Standard tooling integration** - leverages existing F# ecosystem

### Standard Tooling and Execution Flexibility
- **Standard F# Interactive (fsi)** - uses `dotnet fsi` for script execution with full .NET ecosystem access
- **Paket integration** - seamless package management and dependency resolution for complex scenarios
- **FSI configuration** - customizable startup scripts, load paths, and environment settings
- **Hosted FSI execution** - fallback execution via MCP F# tools when standard fsi is not available
- **Terminal monitoring** - capture and analyze fsi output through standard streams or hosted execution
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments

## F# Script-Driven Capabilities

### Strengths
- **F# Interactive (fsi)** provides robust script execution
- **NuGet integration** via `#r "nuget:"` directives for dependency management
- **Paket integration** for advanced dependency resolution and version management
- **FSI configuration** through `.fsx` startup scripts and environment customization
- **Hosted execution fallback** via MCP F# tools when standard fsi environment unavailable
- **File-based development** with `.fsx` scripts that are version-controllable
- **Library compilation** to `.dll` packages for distribution
- **Cross-platform execution** via .NET tooling with consistent behavior
- **Performance profiling** through execution timing and metrics
- **Terminal output capture** for automated analysis and decision making

### Script Organization Patterns
- **Modular script structure** - separate concerns into focused scripts
- **Dependency management** - explicit package references and loading order
- **Output formatting** - structured `printfn` for machine-readable results
- **Error handling** - comprehensive validation and error reporting

## Script-Driven Development Patterns

### 1. Validation-First Development
Create scripts that validate expected behavior before implementation:

```fsharp
// validation_script.fsx
#r "nuget: MyLibrary"
open MyLibrary

printfn "=== Testing Core Functionality ==="

// Test case 1: Basic operation
let result1 = processData [1; 2; 3]
let expected1 = [2; 4; 6]
let success1 = result1 = expected1
printfn "Test 1: %s - Expected: %A, Got: %A" 
    (if success1 then "PASS" else "FAIL") expected1 result1

// Test case 2: Edge cases
let result2 = processData []
let expected2 = []
let success2 = result2 = expected2
printfn "Test 2: %s - Expected: %A, Got: %A" 
    (if success2 then "PASS" else "FAIL") expected2 result2

// Summary
let allPassed = success1 && success2
printfn "=== SUMMARY: %s ===" (if allPassed then "ALL TESTS PASSED" else "SOME TESTS FAILED")
```

### 2. Incremental Component Testing
Build and test components incrementally:

```fsharp
// component_test.fsx
#load "DataTypes.fs"
#load "CoreLogic.fs"
#load "ValidationLogic.fs"

printfn "=== Component Integration Test ==="

// Test data type creation
let testData = DataTypes.createSample()
printfn "Data creation: %s" (if testData.IsEmpty then "FAIL" else "PASS")

// Test core logic
let processed = CoreLogic.process testData
printfn "Core processing: %s" (if processed.Length > 0 then "PASS" else "FAIL")

// Test validation
let validated = ValidationLogic.validate processed
printfn "Validation: %s" (if validated.IsValid then "PASS" else "FAIL")

printfn "=== Integration: %s ===" 
    (if validated.IsValid then "SUCCESS" else "FAILED")
```

### 3. Performance and Benchmarking Scripts
Measure and validate performance characteristics:

```fsharp
// performance_test.fsx
#r "nuget: MyLibrary"
#time "on"

open System.Diagnostics
open MyLibrary

printfn "=== Performance Testing ==="

let stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew()

// Warm up
let _ = heavyComputation [1..100]

stopwatch.Restart()
let result = heavyComputation [1..10000]
stopwatch.Stop()

printfn "Computation completed in: %d ms" stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds
printfn "Result size: %d items" (List.length result)
printfn "Performance: %s" 
    (if stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds < 1000 then "ACCEPTABLE" else "NEEDS_OPTIMIZATION")
```

### 4. API Exploration and Documentation
Create scripts that explore and document API usage:

```fsharp
// api_exploration.fsx
#r "nuget: NewLibrary"
open NewLibrary

printfn "=== API Exploration: NewLibrary ==="

// Discover basic functionality
try
    let client = createClient()
    printfn "Client creation: SUCCESS"
    
    let data = client.getData()
    printfn "Data retrieval: SUCCESS - %d items received" data.Length
    
    let processed = data |> List.map client.processItem
    printfn "Data processing: SUCCESS - %d items processed" processed.Length
    
with ex ->
    printfn "API Error: %s" ex.Message

printfn "=== API Status: DOCUMENTED ==="
```

## Script Structure Guidelines

### Output Format Standards
- **Clear section headers** using `===` delimiters
- **Explicit pass/fail indicators** for each test
- **Summary sections** with overall status
- **Structured data output** using consistent formatting
- **Error reporting** with actionable information

### Script Organization
- **Single responsibility** - each script tests one specific aspect
- **Clear naming conventions** - descriptive filenames indicating purpose
- **Dependency declarations** at the top of each script
- **Consistent structure** - setup, execution, validation, summary
- **Self-contained** - minimal external dependencies

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Project Structure
```
/MyProject
  /src
    /MyProject.Core          # Core library code
    /MyProject.Utils         # Utility functions
  /scripts
    /validation              # Core functionality validation
    /integration            # Component integration tests
    /performance            # Performance benchmarks
    /exploration            # API and library exploration
  /packages                 # Generated NuGet packages
  MyProject.sln             # Solution file
```

### Build and Test Pipeline
1. **Compile libraries** to ensure code correctness
2. **Package as NuGet** for script consumption
3. **Execute validation scripts** in sequence
4. **Collect and analyze output** for decision making
5. **Generate reports** from script execution results

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Script Execution and Analysis
- **Standard fsi execution** via `dotnet fsi script.fsx` for full .NET environment access
- **Hosted fsi execution** through MCP F# tools when standard environment unavailable
- **Paket script execution** with `paket fsi script.fsx` for complex dependency scenarios
- **Output parsing** to extract structured results from both execution modes
- **Success/failure detection** through standardized indicators regardless of execution method
- **Performance metrics extraction** from timing data and execution telemetry
- **Error analysis** from exception and failure messages across execution environments
- **Terminal output capture** via standard streams or hosted execution monitoring

### Decision Making Based on Results
- **Regression detection** by comparing current vs. previous runs
- **Performance monitoring** through execution time analysis
- **Quality assessment** via test pass/fail ratios
- **Integration validation** through multi-component testing

## Best Practices for Script-Driven Development

### 1. Design for Automation
- **Consistent output format** for reliable parsing
- **Clear success/failure criteria** for automated decision making
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging and analysis
- **Error handling** that provides actionable information

### 2. Maintain Script Quality
- **Version control all scripts** alongside source code
- **Regular script maintenance** to keep up with API changes
- **Documentation within scripts** explaining purpose and expected outcomes
- **Modular design** for reusability across projects

### 3. Optimize for Agent Consumption
- **Machine-readable output** with structured formatting
- **Explicit status reporting** for each validation point
- **Standardized error reporting** for consistent error handling
- **Performance metrics** for optimization decisions

### 4. Incremental Development Support
- **Small, focused scripts** for specific functionality
- **Build dependency chains** through script sequencing
- **Validation at each step** before proceeding to next component
- **Rollback capability** through version-controlled artifacts

## When to Use Script-Driven Development

### Ideal Scenarios
- **Agent-driven development** requiring structured feedback
- **Complex system validation** needing reproducible testing
- **Performance-critical applications** requiring benchmarking
- **Library development** needing comprehensive API validation
- **Regulatory environments** requiring audit trails
- **Distributed team development** needing shared validation standards

### Less Suitable Scenarios
- **Rapid prototyping** where exploration is more important than validation
- **Interactive debugging** of complex runtime issues
- **Real-time system development** requiring immediate feedback
- **Exploratory data analysis** with unknown data characteristics

## Transitioning to Production

### From Scripts to Production Code
1. **Extract validated patterns** from successful scripts
2. **Convert validation scripts** to unit/integration tests
3. **Package libraries** for production deployment
4. **Create deployment scripts** based on validation patterns
5. **Establish monitoring** using metrics discovered during script development

### Maintaining Script-Driven Insights
- **Preserve validation scripts** as regression test suite
- **Document discovered patterns** for future reference
- **Maintain performance baselines** established through benchmarking
- **Keep exploration scripts** for ongoing API documentation

## Comparison with REPL-Driven Approach

| Aspect | Script-Driven | REPL-Driven |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Feedback Speed | After script execution | Immediate |
| Reproducibility | Fully reproducible | Session-dependent |
| State Management | Fresh execution each time | Persistent session |
| Error Recovery | Edit and re-run | Interactive debugging |
| Documentation | Explicit in script artifacts | Emergent through use |
| Agent Integration | Excellent structured output | Requires session management |
| Exploration | Structured and planned | Natural and fluid |
| Validation | Comprehensive and automated | Manual and interactive |
| Audit Trail | Complete and versioned | Dependent on session history |

Both approaches have their place in F# development, and they can be complementary - using REPL for initial exploration and script-driven development for validation and production-ready testing workflows.
