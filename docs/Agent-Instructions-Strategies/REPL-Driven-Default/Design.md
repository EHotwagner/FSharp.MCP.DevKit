# F# REPL-Driven Development Strategy for Agent Development

## Core Philosophy

REPL-driven development is fundamentally about **programming by conversation** - building software by interacting with it as it runs, teaching the system how to become your program incrementally through live interaction.

Unlike script-based development, REPL-driven development emphasizes immediate feedback, exploration, and the ability to modify running systems without losing state or context.

## What Makes a "Real" REPL

Not all interactive shells are true REPLs. A real REPL-driven environment provides:

1. **Full System Access**: The entire development system is accessible from the REPL - no artificial limitations
2. **Breakloops**: When errors occur, drop into an interactive debugger within the context of the suspended computation
3. **Live Code Modification**: Redefine functions, types, and data structures while the program runs
4. **State Preservation**: Maintain running state across code changes and redefinitions
5. **Dynamic Introspection**: Inspect and modify all live data and program state interactively

## Core Workflow

1. **Start the interactive session** and begin building incrementally
2. **Define functions and types** directly in the REPL
3. **Test immediately** by calling functions with sample data
4. **Encounter errors** and drop into breakloops for investigation
5. **Fix problems interactively** by redefining code or modifying state
6. **Continue execution** without losing context or restarting
7. **Evolve the program** through continuous interaction and refinement
8. **Extract stable code** to source files when ready

## Key Advantages

- **Immediate Feedback** - See results instantly without compilation delays
- **Exploratory Programming** - Discover solutions through experimentation rather than upfront design
- **Error Recovery** - Fix problems and continue execution without losing state
- **Live Debugging** - Inspect and modify running programs interactively
- **Rapid Prototyping** - Build and test ideas incrementally with minimal overhead
- **Contextual Development** - Work within the actual runtime environment of your program
- **Reduced Cognitive Load** - Focus on one piece at a time without managing entire program lifecycle

## F# REPL Capabilities and Limitations

### Strengths
- **F# Interactive (fsi)** provides immediate expression evaluation
- **Scripting support** with `.fsx` files that can be loaded and reloaded
- **REPL integration** with editors like VS Code, Visual Studio, and others
- **Package management** through `#r "nuget:"` directives
- **Module system** allowing incremental loading and namespace management

### Current Limitations
- **Limited breakloop support** - errors typically return to prompt rather than suspending computation
- **Type redefinition constraints** - changing type definitions may require session restart
- **State management challenges** - global state can become inconsistent across redefinitions
- **No automatic instance updating** - existing objects don't automatically conform to new type definitions

## REPL-Driven Development Patterns

### 1. Bottom-Up Construction
Start with small functions and data structures, building complexity incrementally:

```fsharp
// Start simple
let add x y = x + y

// Test immediately
add 2 3 // => 5

// Build up complexity
let addList numbers = List.fold (+) 0 numbers
addList [1; 2; 3; 4] // => 10

// Refine based on testing
let addListSafe numbers = 
    if List.isEmpty numbers then 0
    else List.fold (+) 0 numbers
```

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Use the REPL to understand data structures and APIs:

```fsharp
// Load and explore data
let data = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
data |> List.map (fun x -> x * 2)
data |> List.filter (fun x -> x % 2 = 0)

// Discover patterns interactively
let processData transform filter items =
    items 
    |> List.map transform
    |> List.filter filter
```

### 3. Interactive Debugging
When functions break, investigate and fix interactively:

```fsharp
// Function that might fail
let divide x y = x / y

// Test and discover failure
divide 10 0 // Exception!

// Fix interactively
let safeDivide x y = 
    if y = 0 then None 
    else Some (x / y)

// Continue testing
safeDivide 10 0 // => None
safeDivide 10 2 // => Some 5
```

### 4. Type-Driven Development
Use the REPL to explore type signatures and contracts:

```fsharp
// Start with type signature
let processUser : User -> Result<ProcessedUser, Error> = 
    fun user -> failwith "not implemented"

// Implement incrementally based on types
let validateUser user = 
    if String.IsNullOrEmpty user.Name 
    then Error "Name required"
    else Ok user

let processUser user =
    user 
    |> validateUser
    |> Result.map transformUser
```

## REPL Session Management

### State Preservation Strategies
- **Restart sessions judiciously** - only when type system constraints require it
- **Use namespaces** to organize and isolate functionality
- **Load order awareness** - understand dependencies between definitions
- **Checkpoint important state** - save significant data structures for quick restoration

### Code Organization in REPL
- **Start in REPL** for exploration and discovery
- **Move to files** when code stabilizes
- **Load from files** using `#load` for reusable components
- **Use script files** (`.fsx`) for REPL-friendly development

## Integration with Tooling

### Editor Integration
- **Send expressions to REPL** from editor buffers
- **Evaluate selections** for targeted testing
- **Load entire files** for comprehensive testing
- **Navigate between REPL and source** seamlessly

### Debugging Integration
- **Set breakpoints** in source files
- **Evaluate expressions** in debug context
- **Modify values** during debugging sessions
- **Hot reload** compatible code changes

## Best Practices for F# REPL Development

### 1. Embrace Immutability
- **Pure functions** are easier to test and reason about in REPL
- **Immutable data** prevents accidental state corruption
- **Functional composition** builds complexity safely

### 2. Design for Interaction
- **Small functions** are easier to test individually
- **Clear signatures** make functions self-documenting
- **Avoid side effects** unless necessary and well-contained

### 3. Iterative Refinement
- **Start simple** and add complexity incrementally
- **Test constantly** to catch issues early
- **Refactor fearlessly** knowing you can test immediately

### 4. Session Hygiene
- **Restart when confused** - don't fight inconsistent state
- **Document discoveries** - capture insights from exploration
- **Extract learnings** - move stable code to permanent files

## When to Use REPL-Driven Development

### Ideal Scenarios
- **Exploring new APIs** or libraries
- **Prototyping algorithms** with uncertain requirements
- **Data analysis** and transformation tasks
- **Interactive debugging** of complex issues
- **Learning new domains** through experimentation

### Less Suitable Scenarios
- **Large refactoring** across multiple files
- **Performance-critical** optimization work
- **Complex type hierarchies** requiring careful planning
- **Multi-threaded** or concurrent programming

## Transitioning to Production

### From REPL to Code
1. **Extract working functions** to module files
2. **Add comprehensive tests** based on REPL experiments
3. **Organize into logical modules** and namespaces
4. **Document APIs** discovered through REPL exploration
5. **Integrate with build systems** for reproducible compilation

### Maintaining REPL-Driven Insights
- **Keep exploration scripts** for future reference
- **Document decision rationale** discovered through experimentation
- **Maintain test cases** derived from REPL interactions
- **Preserve working examples** for API usage patterns

## Comparison with Script-Based Approach

| Aspect | REPL-Driven | Script-Based |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Feedback Speed | Immediate | After script execution |
| State Management | Persistent session | Fresh execution each time |
| Error Recovery | Interactive debugging | Edit and re-run |
| Exploration | Natural and fluid | Structured and planned |
| Documentation | Emergent through use | Explicit in script comments |
| Reproducibility | Session-dependent | Fully reproducible |
| Learning Curve | Requires REPL discipline | Standard development patterns |

Both approaches have their place, and experienced developers often combine them - using REPL for exploration and discovery, then capturing insights in scripts for reproducible development workflows.
