An experimental prototype of an F# development toolkit delivered via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. It provides F# Interactive (FSI) capabilities, code documentation, safe code manipulation, and analysis tools with language server features. Integration with the FAKE build system is under development.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer (by EHotwagner)

This project has been developed with significant reliance on AI-driven tools. While it has proven to be surprisingly effective‚Äîlargely by leveraging robust libraries like **F# Compiler Services** and **Fantomas**‚Äîit will contain inaccuracies or incomplete features. Especially regarding Documentation, the agent tends to insert tons of industry buzzword BS whenever you look away for a second.

### Please Note

- **Code Verification**: The entire codebase and its documentation have not been manually verified for correctness or completeness. However, the core features described should be functional (as in I have seen them work at least once).
- **Agent Stability**: The AI agent's instructions are generally initially effective, but after it deviates, restarting the agent to reset its context is recommended.
- **DevEnvironment**: This project has been developed in VSCode with GH Copilot, mostly using Claude Sonnet 4 and a bit of Gemini 2.5 Pro for planning and design. <https://austen.info/blog/github-copilot-agent-mcp/>
- **Design**: Documentation is written somewhat with REPL-driven development in mind, allowing for interactive code generation and testing. I am currently tending towards a more script-driven development approach, which allows for structured experimentation and reproducible testing. A new, more rigorous approach, **Signature-Driven Development**, is also being considered.
  - [REPL-Driven Development](./docs/Agent-Instructions-Strategies/REPL-Driven-Default/Design.md)
  - [Script-Driven Development](./docs/Agent-Instructions-Strategies/Script-Driven-Default/Design.md)
  - [Signature-Driven Development](./docs/Agent-Instructions-Strategies/Signature-Driven-Default/Design.md)

- REPL works with hosted FSI sessions, which in this context are not easy to configure, a bit fragile with some Input, have no nice output (only MCP-Tools output terminal and agent chat window). Letting the agent start a standard fsi process in an agent observed terminal is of course possible but cumbersome in VSCode since terminal actions need approval. This project should be neutral to the chosen approach in the future. VsCode Insiders has <https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/253103> which changes the ergonomics a lot. Needs consideration.
- **Get Started**: There are no releases yet. For VSCode use this <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/build-a-model-context-protocol-mcp-server-in-csharp/> approach. Add the project to the mcp.json file. Later a dotnet tool might be the best way to distribute this project.
- **Contributions Welcome**: This project is open to contributions.
- **Status**: Need to do lots of research next. These are tools for AI agents not humans. The complete agent system is something like: model + context + tools. I need to know more about Context management and what tools might work with what context. Improving prototyped tools might not be that useful, maybe less is more, who knows. How to best integrate fake and dotnet tool support is very important in my opinion since it gives the agent controlled and structured ways to iterate.
