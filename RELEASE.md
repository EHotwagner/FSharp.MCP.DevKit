# Release Notes - v0.1.0

This is the initial release of the FSharp.MCP.DevKit, an experimental AI-native F# development toolkit delivered via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Key Features

*   **AI-Native F# Development Toolkit**: Equips AI agents with language server-grade analysis for instant error feedback, safe Fantomas-powered code editing, and on-demand documentation generation for NuGet packages.
*   **F# Interactive Integration**: Provides a persistent FSI session, code execution, script loading, and package management.
*   **Documentation Generation & Search**: Generates comprehensive API docs for NuGet packages and projects, with a smart search functionality.
*   **Safe Code Manipulation**: Offers safe code insertion, formatting, structure analysis, and preview capabilities.
*   **Advanced Analysis Tools**: Includes symbol detection, syntax validation, and dependency analysis.

## Known Issues

*   This is an experimental prototype, and the entire codebase has not been manually verified for correctness or completeness.
*   The AI agent's instructions may deviate, and restarting the agent might be necessary.
*   The project has been developed primarily in VSCode with GH Copilot, using Claude Sonnet 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro.
